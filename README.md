# Simple RSS Server

This is a simple project that shows how a RSS server can be implemented in Go
with only the standard library. The Simple RSS Server isn't very useful at this
point, since the data is hard-coded and can not be changed, and serves more as a
demonstration of the strength of the Go's standard library. 

In the future I would like to implement:
- Database and some algorithm to update the feed with the latest articles
- CMS or some endpoint for adding new articles
- Maybe a blog
